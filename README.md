# RustFest landing page

Rust people know what Rust documentation looks like,
so why not use that for a sponsor landing page?

## How it works

1. People at RustFest get a coffee
2. Cup has a link to <rust.thetc.se>
3. Page shows what you get when you run `cargo doc --open` in this repo
4. ???
5. PROFIT!
